2.	Hop in the range for 30 mins – practice med bots twice as fast as u can and once as precise as u can
3.	If you whiff consistently – get your gun of choice, disable inf ammo, practice 20 and 30m target and try doing spray control
4.	Practice hard spike defusing (jiggle peek corners) and medium spike planting (just kill everyone)
